The dataset essentially contains ~24000 images of cats and dogs together. 
The images have been converted to monochrome 50x50 matrices and stored. The way its currently stored enables it to be compatible with pytorch's dataloader utility.

On a isolated validation batch of size 400, the following results were obtained.
